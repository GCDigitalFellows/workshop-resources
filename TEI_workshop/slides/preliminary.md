# Preliminary Questions for Project Analysis

Before begining any encoding project, it's important to take some time to think through your goals for the project, weighing them against an analysis of the document itself. The strength of TEI lies in its robustness and potential for customization, so its users need to be extremely aware of their document's key features and other details that they want the TEI to capture. They need to consider not just the document, but their audience, their research goals,and how they wish to represent textual data.

Because there are many directions that a TEI project might take, below are some guiding questions, provided by the WWP, for preliminary document and project analysis.

1. As far as you can tell, how is the document structured?
2. Are there any kinds of regularization or editorial amendment you will perform as you transcribe the text?
3. How much information about the appearance of the document do you need to capture?

In your groups, take a few minutes to review these questions, using the below documents from the [*Picture of Dorian Gray*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray) manuscript as a sample source text. Based on what you can tell from the images, how would you approach the encoding of such a text? We will touch base in five or ten minutes.
