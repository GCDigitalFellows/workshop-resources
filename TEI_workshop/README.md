## The Graduate Center Digital Initiatives

First, welcome to this workshop, sponsored by the Graduate Center Digital Initiatives, and in particular, the Digital Fellows. GCDI offers different kinds of support for digital scholarship in the GC. Some of the more popular resources we offer are regular workshops (like this one), walk-in office hours (in room 7417, the Digital Scholarship Lab), working groups based around common tools or data sources (such as python or mapping), special events (check our calendar!) and online resources. 

Some ways to get involved: 
- Check the [Event Calendar](cuny.is/workshops) for upcoming events and workshops: cuny.is/workshops
- Drop-in to Office Hours in the Digital Scholarship Lab, room 7414. Dates and times on the calendar.
- Follow GCDI or the Digital Fellows on Twitter: [@cunygcdi](https://twitter.com/cunygcdi?lang=en) and [@digital_fellows](https://twitter.com/digital_fellows?lang=en).
- Follow (and post to!) the **#digitalGC** hashtag on Twitter
- Join [the GCDI Group](cuny.is/group-gcdi) on the CUNY Academic Commons for all GCDI-related updates! cuny.is/group-gcdi

## Getting Started with TEI

TEI (short for [Text Encoding Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative)) is a method for encoding, or marking up, texts in such a way that humans and computers can make sense of them. It is a set of guidelines for electronic editing that facilitates the digitization and transcription of textual material. The guidelines are maintained by the [TEI Consortium](https://tei-c.org/), which provides extensive resources for for marking up all kinds of text into digital format. Their recommendations mostly consist of rules for using various “tags” to mark up certain textual elements, such as **&lt;line>** to indicate a line of text, **&lt;del>**, to indicate deleted text, and **&lt;person>**, for a reference to a person.

You might be wondering why someone would want to go through the trouble of marking up a text for digitization, when scanning it is so much quicker and easier. There are many ways to answer this question, but let's look at one specific affordance of TEI, which is facilitating deep and complex search of textual material. The [Willa Cather Archive](https://cather.unl.edu), a digital archive of the author's novels, stories, nonfiction, letters, and journalism, offers both electronic text and high-quality scanned images of the same works. We can specifically see the TEI at work in Cather's correspondance. Here, [a seemingly simple search tool](https://cather.unl.edu/letters/search) reveals a precision and complexity that you wouldn't get with just a direct transcription or scanned images. 

Besides encoding text for searching, you might provide a diplomatic transcription, reproducing the typography the manuscript original, or encode editorial and authorial changes to a text over time. Because TEI is built to be customizable, many projects develop their own standards based on one of the existing guidelines, tailoring them to capture the key features of their source text. 

### Objectives

For today's workshop, we will be delving into the workings of TEI and practice using it hands-on. You will leave having accomplished the following:
- Understand what TEI is and why it's used.
- Recognize the basic structure of a TEI document.
- Practice using a specific subset of TEI guidelines to encode a manuscript.

### Agenda

- First, we will examine the guidelines, getting a brief overview of a basic TEI document and some of the key elements.
- Second, I will demostrate a quick tutorial on how to implement a specific subset of the guidelines, drawing elements from the Primary Source Editing module. 
- Finally, for rest the workshop, you will get the opportunity to practice TEI by encoding a manuscript page (in groups), and we will share our work.
