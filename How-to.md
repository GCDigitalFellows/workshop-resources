# How to add workshop files and documents

- It is strongly suggested that you download the repository to your computer and edit it there directly.
- All files are to be added to the folder named with the general topic. For example, all documents related to mapping workshops should be in the "Mapping" folder.
- If the folder does not exist, go ahead and create it. Keep the wording general and simple, e.g. "Mapping" instead of "QGIS using Mapping", so that future related workshops can also be archived under the same folder.
- If you create a new folder, make sure to also edit the README.md of the parent directory to include a link to the respective folder.
- Within the folder, create another "README.md" file. You can copy the one from the Mapping folder and use that one as a model, so that we keep the formatting harmonized.
- Each workshop should be listed on the README.md of the topic folder. The link to the workshop's repository (guide) should be included in parenthesis after the date and title of the workshop on the list. Any other materials (e.g. Powerpoint slides or shortcut sheet) can also be included as additional parentheses (see the example in the Mapping one).
- These additional files should be placed in a subfolder called "YEARSeason-TOPIC OF WORKSHOP" (e.g. 2019Fall-Mapping).
- Any links or materials that are useful broadly and not only for a specific workshop can be added directly to the parent directory.
